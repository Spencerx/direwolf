%R%	The sample config file was getting pretty messy
%R%	with the Windows and Linux differences.
%R%	It would be a maintenance burden to keep most of
%R%	three different versions in sync.
%R%	This common source is now used to generate the
%R%	three different variations while having only a single
%R%	copy of the common parts.
%R%
%R%	The first column contains one of the following:
%R%
%R%		R	remark which is discarded.
%R%		C	common to both versions.

%C%# Questions???  Join the discussion forum:  https://groups.io/g/direwolf
%C%#
%C%#
%C%# This sample file does not have examples for all of the possibilities.
%C%# Consult the User Guide for more details on configuration options
%C%# and other documents for more details for different uses.
%C%#
%C%# These are the most likely settings you might change:
%C%#
%C%#	(1)   	MYCALL 	-  call sign and SSID for your station.
%C%#
%C%#			Look for lines starting with MYCALL and
%C%#			change NOCALL to your own callsign and optional SSID.
%C%#
%C%#	(2)	PBEACON	-  enable position beaconing.
%C%#
%C%#			Look for lines starting with PBEACON and
%C%#			modify for your location, symbol, comment, etc.
%C%#
%C%#	(3)	DIGIPEATER  -  configure digipeating rules.
%C%#
%C%#			Look for lines starting with DIGIPEATER.
%C%#			Most people will probably use of of the two examples.
%C%#
%C%#	(4)	IGSERVER, IGLOGIN  - IGate server and login
%C%#
%C%#			Configure an IGate client to relay messages between
%C%#			radio and internet servers.
%C%#
%C%#
%C%# The default location is "direwolf.conf" in the current working directory.
%L%# On Linux, the user's home directory will also be searched.
%C%# An alternate configuration file location can be specified with the "-c" command line option.
%C%#
%C%# As you probably guessed by now, # indicates a comment line.
%C%#
%C%# Remove the # at the beginning of a line if you want to use a sample
%C%# configuration that is currently commented out.
%C%#
%C%# Commands are a keyword followed by parameters.
%C%#
%C%# Command key words are case insensitive.  i.e. upper and lower case are equivalent.
%C%#
%C%# Command parameters are generally case sensitive.  i.e. upper and lower case are different.

%C%# Many people will simply use the default sound device.
%C%# Some might want to use an alternative device by choosing it here.
%C%#
%C%#
%C%# Many examples of radio interfaces and PTT options can be found in: 
%C%# https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wb2osz/direwolf-doc/main/Radio-Interface-Guide.pdf
%C%#
%C%#
%R% ---------- Windows ----------
%R%
%W%# When the Windows version starts up, it displays something like
%W%# this with the available sound devices and capabilities:
%W%#
%W%#	Available audio input devices for receive (*=selected):
%W%#	   *  0: Microphone (C-Media USB Headpho   (channel 2)
%W%#	      1: Microphone (Bluetooth SCO Audio
%W%#	      2: Microphone (Bluetooth AV Audio)
%W%#	 *    3: Microphone (Realtek High Defini   (channels 0 & 1)
%W%#	Available audio output devices for transmit (*=selected):
%W%#	   *  0: Speakers (C-Media USB Headphone   (channel 2)
%W%#	      1: Speakers (Bluetooth SCO Audio)
%W%#	      2: Realtek Digital Output(Optical)
%W%#	      3: Speakers (Bluetooth AV Audio)
%W%#	 *    4: Speakers (Realtek High Definiti   (channels 0 & 1)
%W%#	      5: Realtek Digital Output (Realtek
%W%#
%W%# It is recommended that you use a unique substring of the device description.
%W%# For example, use "High" or "Realtek High Def" for the built in sound system.
%W%# Use "USB", or a longer string to distinguish amount multiple devices for a USB audio.
%W%# You can also use numbers but you are asking for trouble.  Device numbers can change.
%W%
%W%#ADEVICE USB
%W%
%W%
%W%# Example: To use the USB Audio, use a command like this with
%W%# the input and output device numbers.  (Remove the # comment character.)
%W%#ADEVICE USB
%W%
%W%# You can also use "-" or "stdin" to pipe stdout from
%W%# some other application such as a software defined radio.
%W%# "stdin" is not an audio device.  Don't use this unless you
%W%# understand what this means.  Read the User Guide.
%W%# You can also specify "UDP:" and an optional port for input.
%W%# Something different must be specified for output.
%W%
%W%# ADEVICE stdin 0
%W%# ADEVICE UDP:7355 0
%W%
%W%# The position in the list can change when devices (e.g. USB) are added and removed.
%W%# You can also specify devices by using part of the name.
%W%# Here is an example of specifying the USB Audio device.
%W%# This is case-sensitive.  Upper and lower case are not treated the same.
%W%
%W%#ADEVICE USB
%W%
%W%
%R% ---------- Linux ----------
%R%
%L%# Linux ALSA is complicated.  See User Guide for discussion.
%L%# To use something other than the default, generally use plughw
%L%# and a card number reported by "arecord -l" command.  Example:
%L%
%L%# ADEVICE  plughw:1,0
%L%
%R% ---------- Mac ----------
%R%
%M%# Macintosh Operating System uses portaudio driver for audio
%M%# input/output. Default device selection not available. User/OP
%M%# must configure the sound input/output option.  Note that
%M%# the device names can contain spaces.  In this case, the names
%M%# must be enclosed by quotes.
%M%#
%M%# Examples:
%M%#
%M%ADEVICE "Built-in Input" "Built-in Output"
%M%
%M%# ADEVICE  "USB Audio Codec:6"  "USB Audio Codec:5"
%M%#

%C%CHANNEL 0
%C%
%C%#
%C%# Station identifier for this channel.
%C%# Multiple channels can have the same or different names.
%C%#
%C%# It can be up to 6 letters and digits with an optional ssid in range of 1 to 15.
%C%# The APRS specification requires that it be upper case.
%C%#
%C%# Example (don't use this unless you are me):  MYCALL WB2OSZ-5
%C%#
%C%
%C%MYCALL N0CALL
%C%
%C%#
%C%# Pick a suitable modem speed based on your situation.
%C%#	1200 	Most common for VHF/UHF.  This is the default if not specified.
%C%#	2400	QPSK compatible with MFJ-2400, and probably PK232-2400 & KPC-2400.
%C%#	300	Low speed for HF SSB.  Default tones 1600 & 1800.
%C%#	EAS	Emergency Alert System (EAS) Specific Area Message Encoding (SAME).
%C%#	9600	G3RUH style - Can't use Microphone and Speaker connections.
%C%#	AIS	International system for tracking ships on VHF.
%C%#			Also uses 9600 bps so Speaker connection won't work.
%C%#
%C%# In most cases you can just specify the speed.  Examples:
%C%#
%C%
%C%#MODEM 300
%C%#MODEM 9600
%C%
%C%#
%C%# Many options are available for great flexibility.
%C%# See User Guide for details.
%C%#
%C%
%C%# Push to Talk (PTT) can be confusing because there are so many different cases.
%C%# https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wb2osz/direwolf-doc/main/Radio-Interface-Guide.pdf
%C%# goes into detail about the various options.
%C%
%C%# If using a C-Media CM108/CM119 or similar USB Audio Adapter,
%C%# you can use a GPIO pin for PTT control. This is very convenient
%C%# because a single USB connection is used for both audio and PTT.
%C%# Example:
%C%
%C%#PTT CM108
%C%
%C%
%C%# There are other possibilities such as serial port RTS, Raspberry Pi GPIO pins,
%C%# and hamlib for CAT control.   For more details see:

%C%# Dire Wolf acts as a virtual TNC and can communicate with
%C%# client applications by different protocols:
%C%#
%C%#	- the "AGW TCPIP Socket Interface" - default port 8000
%C%#	- KISS protocol over TCP socket - default port 8001
%W%#	- KISS TNC via serial port
%L%#	- KISS TNC via pseudo terminal   (-p command line option)

%C%# Beaconing is configured with these two commands:
%C%#
%C%#	PBEACON		- for a position report (usually yourself)
%C%#	OBEACON		- for an object report (usually some other entity)
%C%#
%C%# Each has a series of keywords and values for options.
%C%# See User Guide for details.

%C%# Example:  Change the latitude and longitude or your location
%C%#           will show you about to go over Niagara Falls.
